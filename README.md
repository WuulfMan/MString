A fully useable string library, without the use of 'cstring' or 'string' libraries, made by Matei Brinzea.

This library is set to imitate, or even do better than the 'string' libraries already existent in C/C++ library modules. All of this has been done using C Strings, pointers and functions made by me(Matei Brinzea).

I hope it will serve well to those who use it. 

Any modifications are welcome ONLY with the approve of Matei Brinzea, the creator of the library.
